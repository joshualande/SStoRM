<p>Alternatly, you could simply download and run the Java Archive (JAR) executable files and run them yourself. You can get SStoRMv1 <a href="SStoRM-v1.0.2.jar">here</a> SStoRMv2 <a href="SStoRM-v2.0.0.jar">here</a>, and SStoRMv3 <a href="SStoRM-v3.0.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using a Mac, SStoRM is only compatable with Tiger, Apple's latest version of their opperating system. This is because Java 1.5 will only run on Tiger. If you have Tiger, you can download and install Java 1.5 from <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html">Apple's website</a>. You can alternatly <a href="SStoRM-v1.0.0.jnlp">run an older version of SStoRM on older Macs</a>.</p>
