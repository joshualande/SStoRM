If this program is not working on your computer, you might need to install Java Web start. You can get Java [here](http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/downloads/index.html).

Alternatly, you could simply download and run the Java Archive (JAR) executable files and run them yourself. You can get SStoRMv1 [here](SStoRM-v1.0.2.jar), SStoRMv2 [here](SStoRM-v2.0.0.jar), and SStoRMv3 [here](SStoRM-v3.0.0).
