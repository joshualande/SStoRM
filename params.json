{"name":"SStoRM","tagline":"SStoRM: the Solar Storm Radiation Model","body":"SStoRM is a free open source computer program that can simulate Solar Particle Events (SPEs). It is written entirely in Java and can be run online using Java Web Start. It is cross platform and can be run on any computer with JAVA installed. Feel free to play around with it.\r\n\r\n[Click here to Run SStoRMv1](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/releases/SStoRM-v1.0.2.jnlp)\r\n\r\n[Click here to Run SStoRMv2](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/releases/SStoRM-v2.0.0.jnlp)\r\n\r\n[Click here to Run SStoRMv3](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/releases/SStoRM-v3.0.0.jnlp)\r\n    \r\nSStoRM lets you simulate an SPE with a user specified energy spectrum and time evolution. It then let you see how much radiation an astronaut would be exposed to in outer space during that event. It then lets you run a simulation of an astronaut on the moon during the event.\r\n\r\n# Why Three Versions?\r\n\r\nThe three version of the program each let you define an SPE differently. SStoRMv1 lets you simulate one SPE at a time. SStoRMv2 lets you simulate two different events happening simultaneously. SStoRMv3 lets you simulate one event that includes a separate Gaussian shock enhanced peak.      \r\n\r\n# Screenshots of SStoRM v1\r\n\r\n### Selecting the fluence of an event:\r\n![Screenshot of the Energy Spectrum.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version1energyspectrumscreenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Selecting the time evolution of the event:\r\n![Screenshot of the Time Evolution.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version1timeevolutionscreenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Viewing the \"Estiamted Dose\" tab:\r\n![Screenshot of the Estimated Dose.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version1estimateddosescreenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Viewing the \"Exercise Tab\":\r\n![Screenshot of the Exercise.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version1exercisescreenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Screenshots of SStoRM v2\r\n\r\n### Selecting the fluence of both events:\r\n![Screenshot of the Energy Spectrum.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version2energyspectrumscreenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Selecting the time evolution of both events:\r\n![Screenshot of the Time Evolution.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version2timeevolutionscreenshot.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Screenshots of SStoRM v3\r\n\r\n### Selecting the time evolution of the shock enhanced peak:\r\n![Screenshot of the Time Evolution.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version3timeevolutionscreenshop.jpg)\r\n\r\n# SStoRM on other operating systems\r\n\r\n### SStoRM running on Windows:\r\n![Screenshot of SStoRM running on windows.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version1windows.jpg)\r\n\r\n### SStoRM running on Ubuntu Linux:\r\n![Screenshot of SStoRM running on linux.](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/images/version2linux.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nA description of SStoRM can be found here: [v1](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/documentation/documentation_SStoRM_v1.pdf), [v2](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/documentation/documentation_SStoRM_v2.pdf), and [v3](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/documentation/documentation_SStoRM_v3.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn addition, [here](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/documentation/lande_SEAP_paper_2004.pdf) my writeup of Joshua Lande's 2004 summer research on this project and [here](http://raw.github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/master/documentation/lande_SEAP_paper_2005.pdf) is Joshua's 2005 writeup.\r\n\r\n# Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nGo [here](http://github.com/joshualande/SStoRM/blob/master/troubleshooting.md) for help troubleshooting any problems with the program.\r\n\r\n# About\r\n\r\nSStoRM was created in 2005 by Joshua Lande and Dr. Ronald Turner at [ANSER](http://www.anser.org). You can contact Joshua Lande [here](mailto:joshualande@gmail.com). SStoRM was created as a result of ANSER's participation in the George Washingtion University [SEAP internship program](http://www.gwseap.net).\r\n\r\n# Open Source\r\n\r\nSStoRM is Open Source.
